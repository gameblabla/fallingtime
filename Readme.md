Falling Time is a game originally made exclusively for the GCW Zero by Cong Xu.
The game plays very similary to FallDown but it puts a higher empathis on speed and scoring.
You can also grab eggplants to increase your overall score too.
The game also has a multiplayer. (it's local though)

On TI Nspire, you really should overclock your calc when possible.
