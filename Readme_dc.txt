Falling Time is a game originally made exclusively for the GCW Zero by Cong Xu.
The game plays very similary to FallDown but it puts a higher empathis on speed and scoring.
You can also grab eggplants to increase your overall score too.
The game also has a local multiplayer mode. (up to 2 players)

The game is automatically saving to the first VMU, maybe i will do a
menu where you can choose the VMU where you want to save.
