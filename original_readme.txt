# Falling Time

Like the fall down games, you are a ball and you must fall into the holes to avoid being crushed by the top of the screen!

This game requires SDL 1.2, CMake and a C compiler. It is optimised for low-resolution screens.

Code is under the GPL version 2; for asset licenses see the `COPYRIGHT` file.

### Building

Use **CMake**, and the libraries **SDL 1.2**, **SDL_image 1.2** and **SDL_mixer 1.2**.

To compile this for PC, use `cmake . && make`. You'll then get a windowed SDL game.

To compile this for GCW-Zero, run `pkg/make_opk.sh` after installing the toolchain as specified in the developer docs.

### Notes

The game uses a custom version of Chipmunk 2D physics; it cannot be replaced with standard libraries.
